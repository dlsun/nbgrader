0.1.0
-----

I'm happy to announce that the first version of nbgrader has (finally) been released! nbgrader is a tool that I've been working on for a little over a year now which provides a suite of tools for creating, releasing, and grading assignments in the Jupyter notebook. So far, nbgrader has been used to grade assignments for the class I ran in the spring, as well as two classes that Brian Granger has taught.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, etc., please do open an issue on the bugtracker. This is still a very new tool, so I am sure there is a lot that can be improved upon!

Thanks so much to all of the people who have contributed to this release by reporting issues and/or submitting PRs:
